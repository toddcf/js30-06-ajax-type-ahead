# JavaScript30 #6: AJAX Type-Ahead

Pulls an array of 1,000 cities (and their basic info, stored in objects).

As the user types into a search field, the app filters the array of cities and displays the results (on each keyup). Users can search by city or state.

The app also displays the population next to each result, and inserts a comma for every three digits.
